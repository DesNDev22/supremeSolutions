                    <section class="testimonial">
                        <p>My auto dealer sent my brand new car here for repair for a scratch on the bumper from the lot. I was a little apprehensive at first because I wasn't sure why the dealer would farm out the body work to an outside contractor given that the dealer had their own body shop. Lauro Jr the owner though did a great job at repairing the bumper and was very professional and courteous. He answered the phone every time I called and was also quick to respond to text messages. He even sent me a photo of the bumper after he was done painting it and you could not tell it had been painted at all. It seems like he does a lot of small touch ups seems to be pretty good at it. Thanks for a good job!</p>

                        <p>Went in to get my bumper and hood painted due to some damage. The quote given was much lower than anywhere else and the work simply spoke for itself, very professional. After they got through with my car you couldn't tell there was ever any damage. Not only was the work professional and the price more than fair, they got it done much quicker than I could haver ever hoped for. This is a great shop!</p>
